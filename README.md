### Hi there, I'm Thomas or @uphillian.
I am a meat popsicle.  I also do devops, currently at Service Now.  I've
written some books on Puppet and devops.  When I'm not coding I enjoy riding
and digging the local MTB trails in the PNW.  When it gets too snowy for the
bike, I like to ski and hurt myself almost every time I go.
